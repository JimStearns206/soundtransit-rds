# Sound Transit Regional Data Services

***open data + open source + open architecture***

## Recent Highlights

We held our developer community kick-off on August 14. We had a great turn-out, a small room full of really talented, enthusiastic folk from around the Puget Sound Region.

**Join our Developer Community Discussion**

One of the first requests by developers is that we establish our forum for discussion of RDS topics. So ... without further ado ... here's our [RDS Developer Community Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/soundtransit-rds) at Google. 

Per feedback from the community, this will be a moderated discussion. For now, we are going to limit participation to active developers so please **include your API Access Key** in your membership request. Or provide a reasonably rationale reason to be included even if you don't have an access key.

**Download Kick-off presentation and notes**

RDS presented an overview of our roadmap for 2013 and the community then weighed in with a bunch of feedback on what they would like to see added, improved and changed in how regional transit data is managed and organized. We even came up with a couple of exciting "save the world - or at least make life better for transit riders" caliber ideas.

Check it out. Here's to the kick-off materials:

* [roadmap presentation](https://github.com/SoundTransit/soundtransit-rds/wiki/docs/dev-meetup-2013-developer-kick-off-pptx.pdf) show the conceptual architecture for 2013-2014 platform build-out

## About Sound Transit Regional Data Services

Sound Transit Regional Data Services provides accurate, reliable access to transit data provided by partner agencies across the Puget Sound region. We make this data available to our Developer Community in order to facilitate innovation in applications and other services for transit riders. We actively collaborate with other transit agencies and regional groups, along with their developer communities, to spread innovation as broadly as possible.

Our Developer Community includes members from independent third-party organizations, partner transit agencies, and all other groups and individuals who make use of transit data provided by Sound Transit Regional Data Services.

## Developer Community Resources

Our GitHub projects provides access to a range of resources having to do with Regional Data Services.

* Our code repository presents open source solutions developed by Sound Transit staff or contributed by members of our developer community.

* Our wiki presents an overview of the Regional Data Services platform as well as build notes and other documents describing various components and processes.

* Finally, we track all RDS-related issues and enhancement requests.

As always, we welcome feedback and suggestions on how we can continually improve both how we are using GitHub and how we provide data and other services to our community of developers.
