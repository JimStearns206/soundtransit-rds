_RDS = open data + open source + open architecture_

Sound Transit Regional Data Services provides accurate, reliable access to transit data provided by partner agencies across the Puget Sound region. We make this data available to our Developer Community in order to facilitate innovation in applications and other services for transit riders. We actively collaborate with other transit agencies and regional groups, along with their developer communities, to spread innovation as broadly as possible.

Our Developer Community includes members from independent third-party organizations, partner transit agencies, and all other groups and individuals who make use of transit data provided by Sound Transit Regional Data Services.

Our GitHub projects provides access to a range of resources having to do with Regional Data Services.

* Our code repository presents open source solutions developed by Sound Transit staff or contributed by members of our developer community.

* Our wiki presents an overview of the Regional Data Services platform as well as build notes and other documents describing various components and processes.

* Finally, we track all RDS-related issues and enhancement requests.

As always, we welcome feedback and suggestions on how we can continually improve both how we are using GitHub and how we provide data and other services to our community of developers.
